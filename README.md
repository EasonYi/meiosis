# Meiosis

Meiosis is a library and an architecture pattern for dividing a web application into small,
independent, manageable, and testable parts.

Meiosis is currently under active development. Once the design and API have stabilized, more
documentation and resources will be produced.

Examples will be added to: https://github.com/foxdonut/meiosis-examples

Meiosis is developed by [foxdonut](https://github.com/foxdonut)
