## Do you Mei-O?

**Meiosis** is a library that manages the data flow of your web applications,
_while letting you keep using the tools that you already love._

For example, you can use [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Inferno](https://github.com/trueadm/inferno),
[snabbdom](https://github.com/paldepind/snabbdom), [Mithril](http://mithril.js.org), [jQuery](http://jquery.com/),
[Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com), or no libraries at all and just plain vanilla JavaScript.

Meiosis implements the [SAM pattern](http://sam.js.org) by [Jean-Jacques Dubray](http://www.ebpml.org/about).

Please see [http://meiosis.js.org](http://meiosis.js.org) for more details.

## Why the name _Meiosis_?

I picked the name **Meiosis** for three reasons:

1. it's a [biology term](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosis) for a type of cell division; this is
an analogy to the idea of dividing your application into smaller pieces;
2. it's a [figure of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosis_(figure_of_speech) that
_intentionally understates something or implies that it is lesser in significance or size than it
really is_, meaning that this library is meant to be small, humble, and not replace what people use,
just improve upon it; and
3. it's a relatively unique name in the JavaScript world, thus making it easy to find information
using search engines.
