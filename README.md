## Do you Mei-O?

**Meiosis** is a library and an architecture pattern for dividing a web application into small,
independent, manageable, and testable parts,
_while letting you keep using the tools that you already love._

The key principles of Meiosis are:
- remain small, with no dependencies, and simple, allowing you to build components with minimal
effort
- provide an architecture to structure your code that scales well as your application gets larger
and more complex
- let you choose the libraries that you want to use: for example,
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [snabbdom](https://github.com/paldepind/snabbdom),
[jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [Immutable](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/),
[mori](http://swannodette.github.io/mori/), or no libraries at all and just plain vanilla JavaScript
- provide functionality out of the box, but allow you to swap implementation details if need be.

Meiosis is currently under active development. Once the design and API have stabilized, more
documentation and resources will be produced.

Examples will be added to: https://github.com/foxdonut/meiosis-examples

## Why the name _Meiosis_?

I picked the name **Meiosis** for three reasons:

1. it's a [biology term](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosis) for a type of cell division; this is
an analogy to the idea of dividing your application into smaller pieces;
2. it's a [figure of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosis_(figure_of_speech) that
_intentionally understates something or implies that it is lesser in significance or size than it
really is_, meaning that this library is meant to be small, humble, and not replace what people use,
just improve upon it; and
3. it's a relatively unique name in the JavaScript world, thus making it easy to find information
using search engines.
