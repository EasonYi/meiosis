## Do you Mei-O?

**Meiosis** is a library and an architecture pattern for dividing a web application into small,
independent, manageable, and testable parts,
_while letting you keep using the tools that you already love._ Meiosis manages the data flow and
lets you choose whatever you like for rendering views.

The key principles of Meiosis are:
- remain small, with no dependencies, and simple, allowing you to build components with minimal
effort
- provide an architecture to structure your code that scales well as your application gets larger
and more complex
- let you choose the libraries that you want to use: for example,
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [jQuery](http://jquery.com/),
[snabbdom](https://github.com/paldepind/snabbdom), [Mithril](http://mithril.js.org),
[Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com), or no libraries at all and just plain vanilla JavaScript
- provide functionality out of the box, but allow you to swap implementation details if need be.

## Why the name _Meiosis_?

I picked the name **Meiosis** for three reasons:

1. it's a [biology term](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosis) for a type of cell division; this is
an analogy to the idea of dividing your application into smaller pieces;
2. it's a [figure of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosis_(figure_of_speech) that
_intentionally understates something or implies that it is lesser in significance or size than it
really is_, meaning that this library is meant to be small, humble, and not replace what people use,
just improve upon it; and
3. it's a relatively unique name in the JavaScript world, thus making it easy to find information
using search engines.
