## Do you Mei-O?

**Meiosis** is a small library that manages the data flow of your web applications,
_while letting you keep using the tools that you already love._

For example, you can use [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Inferno](https://github.com/trueadm/inferno),
[Mithril](http://mithril.js.org), [snabbdom](https://github.com/paldepind/snabbdom), [Preact](https://preactjs.com/),
[jQuery](http://jquery.com/), or no libraries at all and just plain vanilla JavaScript.

Meiosis implements the [SAM pattern](http://sam.js.org) by [Jean-Jacques Dubray](http://www.ebpml.org/about).

Try out the examples online: http://meiosis.js.org/example-index.html

For documentation please refer to the [Meiosis Guide](https://www.gitbook.com/book/foxdonut/meiosis-guide/).

You can also discuss on the [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/foxdonut/meiosis).

## NEW in version 1.0

With version 1.0 comes a different approach to Meiosis. The core goals are the same, but the library is much
smaller - just a few of utility functions. As such, you could say Meiosis is more of an *approach* to managing web
application data flow, rather than a library.

[Meiosis-Tracer](https://github.com/foxdonut/meiosis-tracer) provides a tool to experiment with and debug an
application. You can trace back through model snapshots, even modify them directly, and see the resulting view.

## PREVIOUS version 0.9

Version 0.9 is the last version to implement the previous approach to Meiosis. The examples and guide corresponding
to that version are still available.

## Why the name _Meiosis_?

I picked the name **Meiosis** for three reasons:

1. it's a [biology term](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosis) for a type of cell division; this is
an analogy to the idea of dividing your application into smaller pieces;
2. it's a [figure of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiosis_(figure_of_speech) that
_intentionally understates something or implies that it is lesser in significance or size than it
really is_, meaning that this library is meant to be small, humble, and not replace what people use,
just improve upon it; and
3. it's a relatively unique name in the JavaScript world, thus making it easy to find information
using search engines.
