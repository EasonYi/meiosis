# Meiosis

Meiosis is a library and an architecture pattern for dividing a web application into small,
independent, manageable, and testable parts.

The key principles of Meiosis are:
- remain small and simple, allowing you to build components with minimal effort
- provide an architecture to structure your code that scales well as your application gets larger
and more complex
- let you use the libraries that you prefer
- provide functionality out of the box, but allow you to swap implementation details if need be.

Meiosis is currently under active development. Once the design and API have stabilized, more
documentation and resources will be produced.

Examples will be added to: https://github.com/foxdonut/meiosis-examples
